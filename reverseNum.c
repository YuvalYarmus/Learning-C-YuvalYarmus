/*
The different types of variables define their bounds. A char can range only from -128 to 127,
whereas a long can range from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
(long and other numeric data types may have another range on different computers,
for example:
from â€“9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 on 64-bit computer).

Note that C does not have a boolean type. Usually, it is defined using the following notation:

#define BOOL char
#define FALSE 0
#define TRUE 1

A long int is a signed integral type that is at least 32 bits,
while a long long or long long int is a signed integral type is at least 64 bits.
